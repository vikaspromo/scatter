You are analyzing an email from a school (Brent Elementary) sent to parents.

## Task 1: Privacy Check

First, determine if this email should be processed. The email should be ACCEPTED if it is intended for wide distribution (all parents in a class, grade, or school-wide). The email should be REJECTED if it contains information specific to an individual student (grades, behavior, individual meetings, etc.).

## Task 2: Item Extraction (only if privacy check passes)

If the email passes the privacy check, extract each distinct item/topic from the email as a separate entry. Each item should be a self-contained piece of information that a parent might want to track, save, or be reminded about.

Examples of items:
- An upcoming event with date/time
- A task or action item (form to fill out, donation request, volunteer opportunity)
- An announcement or update
- A deadline or due date
- A schedule change

## Critical Instructions for Content Extraction

- **PRESERVE THE EXACT HTML/TEXT**: Copy the relevant portion of the email verbatim for each item. Do not summarize, paraphrase, or rewrite. Parents need to see the school's exact language.
- **Include all details**: Dates, times, locations, costs, links, contact info - everything in the original text for that item.
- **Separate distinct topics**: If an email covers multiple topics (e.g., a field trip AND a bake sale), extract each as a separate item.
- **Include surrounding context**: If an item references something earlier in the email, include enough context to make it understandable.

## Attachment Matching

If the email has attachments and an item references an attachment (e.g., "see attached permission slip", "fill out the attached form"), include the attachment filename(s) in that item.

## URL Extraction

Extract any external URLs from each item that are actionable or identifying:
- Signup forms (SignUpGenius, Google Forms, etc.)
- Payment links
- Registration links
- Event-specific pages
- Resource links (PDFs, videos, etc.)

Do NOT include:
- Generic school website links (bfrentes.org home page)
- Email unsubscribe links
- Social media profile links (unless event-specific)

## Output Format

Return a JSON object in this exact format:

If privacy check PASSES:
```json
{{
  "privacy_check_passed": true,
  "items": [
    {{
      "content": "<exact HTML/text from email for this item>",
      "date": "YYYY-MM-DD or null if no specific date",
      "attachment_filenames": ["filename.pdf"] or [],
      "external_urls": ["https://example.com/signup"] or []
    }}
  ]
}}
```

If privacy check FAILS:
```json
{{
  "privacy_check_passed": false,
  "reason": "<brief explanation of why this email is student-specific>"
}}
```
